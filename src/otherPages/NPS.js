      <p>
      As an investor, you lock in the price of a stock with the hope that it will go up in value. However, the risk of an option is that the stock could also lose money.
      So if the stock decreases from its initial price, you lose the money of the contract.Options are an advanced investing technique and retail should exercise caution before using them.

      </p>
      <p>
      Another way to generate income through options trading is by employing strategies such as writing covered calls or selling cash-secured puts. In a covered call strategy, an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells call options against it, earning premiums while potentially benefiting from the asset's appreciation. Similarly, selling cash-secured puts involves selling put options while holding sufficient cash to buy the asset if the option is exercised. Both strategies can create a steady stream of income through the collection of option premiums, particularly in stable or sideways markets where significant price movements are less likely.
